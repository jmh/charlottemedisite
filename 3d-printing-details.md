# 3D Printing Details

Last updated: 3/25/2020

Thank you for your interest in 3d printing medical face shields!

Once you've [signed up as a volunteer] please read through this page to make sure that you know what to print, how to disinfect your prints, and how to package them to keep them disinfected.

<em>Because this is a rapidly evolving situation, the instructions on this page are subject to change. Please check back regularly to ensure you stay up to date!</em>

## What to Print

    [aside]
    Print Bed Size Requirements
    * RC2 (preferred): 20cm x 20cm
    * RC1: 16mm x 16mm
    >> I don't know if either of these is accurate, please verify!

    Print Details
    * Material: PLA (preferred) or PETG
    * Layer Height: 0.20mm - 0.30mm
    * Infill: 30%

> Clear picture of the current recommended RC (caption with Material & Model)

Based on feedback from our medical partners we recommend printing the [RC2 version](link to stl/zip) of the faceshield.

If you have a smaller printer you might be able to print the [RC1 version](link to other files).

* [Other Versions](link to github dir of version zips?)


## Print Clean!

While we strive to help, *we must above all do no harm!*

    [aside]
    * Bleach solution - 1/4 cup bleach to 1 gallon of water
    * Isopropyl or Rubbing alcohol - should be at least 71% to be effective.
    >> I pulled these numbers out of my butt, please provide accurate guidance!
    > Info about what not to do as it becomes clear.

There is no tested sterilization protocol for 3D prints. Please follow the guidelines below to keep your prints as disinfected as possible.

* Minimize Handling
  Less touching means less potential transfer of viruses and other pathogens.
  
* Wash Your Hands
  Wash thoroughly (for 20 seconds) with soap and warm water before handling the printed pieces.

* Wear a Mask or Bandana
  Don't breath on the printed pieces.

* Disinfect Each Piece
  Wipe down, or dunk each piece in isopropyl alcohol OR bleach solution OR use a reasonable disinfectant spray. Set aside on a disinfected surface to dry.
  >> What is a "reasonable disinfectant spray"?


## How to Package Your Prints

We recommend using gallon zip-top bags to hold your finished prints.

* Each printed piece should be labeled in Sharpie with the MATERIAL and the MODEL printed.

* Each printed piece should go into its own gallon zip-top bag.

* Label the bag with MATERIAL / MODEL / DATE / YOUR NAME

> picture of labeled bag

* Disinfect the outside of the bag and keep it clean!

Even if you are unable to complete all of these steps, we can still use your prints! Please clearly mark the bags holding your prints with "NOT DISINFECTED". That way we can handle these prints safely with disinfectant and quarantine at the assembly site.

## Next Steps

Once you've printed *at least 5* face shields tops and bottoms you can deliver your prints to a drop-off site. If you're unable to deliver the prints one of our volunteers can come to you and pick them up.

Visit our [Drop-off Sites] page to find out where to drop off your finished prints.

> A 1 or 2 sentence paragraph explaining pickup and linking to the request pickup page, or however that works.
